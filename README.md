A game where you need to move to the end goal with a grappling hook, within a time limit... but there are 3 separate "worlds" to switch between, each with a specific type of obstacle becoming solid. Getting past or hooking onto these obstacles is the focus of the game.

Believe it or not, this mainly served as a test for rendering tiled maps using WebGL, with a kind of deferred lighting setup. This was the bulk of the game's development - ideally more time could have been spent on levels or art, but I wanted to try something new instead.

If you feel the game is too complicated to jump into immediately, you can mess around in the practice mode at /sandbox.html.
